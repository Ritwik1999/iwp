All php code is first interpreted by the server, then is sent to the client. The browser renders the page as per the markup sent from the server
Tip: To see how the server has rendered the output of the php code, view the page source from the context menu.
This is because the php server renders the page after evaluating all the php code
Take note of difference between single quote printing and double quote printing

For xampp in linux (lampp), php configurations can be modified in /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini
The independent php (not the one that is bundled with xampp) configurations are in /etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini

Remember: Whenever a page is fetched, the request method is GET, unless otherwise changed. And it is a good practice to submit any request that is going to affect a database in any way via a POST request
For example, to delete a product (db record(s)), we could pass one of its unique fields in a query string, but that would submit a get request.
To overcome this, create a separate form, and use these buttons to submit a hidden input field that has the unique product value
